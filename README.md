## About

Mono is a utility suite for focused, distraction-free workflows. Built in Swift with SwiftUI, Mono offers a quiet, clutter-free home screen and a curated set of tools that stay out of your way.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Minimalist** - Monospaced UI with a pure black-and-white palette
- **Low-Stimulation** - Little to no motion, color, or haptics
- **Modular** - Every feature lives in its own independent Swift Package
- **E-Ink Inspired** - High-contrast, low-motion interface for clarity and focus
